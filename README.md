# 🚀Mehrmux - OS Queue Algorithm Visualizer

A Tauri-based application that visualizes different operating system queue algorithms using real-time simulation. Built with **React**, the app features an interactive and dynamic visualization of various scheduling algorithms with **exponential distribution**-based job arrival times. The project also includes performance benchmarks for each queue type to analyze their efficiency.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎨 **Beautiful real-time visualization** of queue algorithms
- 📊 **Benchmarking & performance analysis** of different scheduling strategies
- 📈 **Exponential distribution-based simulation** for realistic job arrival times
- 🖥 **Tauri-powered desktop application** (lightweight & fast)
- ⚡ **Built with React & Rust** for a smooth and modern UI/UX

---

## 📊 Benchmarking Results

The application measures the performance of each queue based on:

- **Average Waiting Time (AWT)**
- **Turnaround Time (TAT)**
- **CPU Utilization**
- **Throughput**

The benchmarks are updated in real-time as the simulation runs, giving insights into the efficiency of each algorithm.
